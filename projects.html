    <p>• Project on Deep Neural Network's Brain tumor detection as the system is trained through MRI Brain images that detects the Brain abnormality. An automated approach has been proposed where MRI gray-scale images were incorporated for brain tumor detection. As this tests grayscale images threshold-based OTSU segmentation was used instead of color segmentation.
        Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook are used.
